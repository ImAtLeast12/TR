    What makes a good president? Could it be being highly famous, or being very charismatic? Could it be having an ambitious personality, or having a photographic memory? What if one president could have all of these traits? In this article, I will be discussing why Theodore Roosevelt is the best president we have ever had.
    Theodore Roosevelt was a highly popular president who served two terms, but what made him so famous? He had a magnetic personality which appealed to people from many walks of life. They were attracted to his ideology, genuine care for the people, and his dedication to the United States. Theodore Roosevelt, unlike most presidents, cared for the people. His agenda broke up monopolies of the railroad, banks, and oil giving him the nickname “Trust Buster.” He was not easily swayed and was able to go up against big business. Roosevelt was a highly ethical person who did not change his views; he was also not persuaded to corrupt ideals. All this together gave him a lot of support by the Commonwealth. 
    Theodore Roosevelt was a natural when it came to international relations. The phrase commonly used by Theodore Roosevelt, “Speak softly, and carry a big stick” means: If you have a big military, and act civil, countries are more apt to respect you. Theodore Roosevelt took the United States out of isolationism; he was aggressive in foreign affairs, he brought the United States to be seen around the world as a global superpower. Often he acted without the support or consent of Congress. He took control of the Philippines from Spain and appointed a governing body to the remote island as it became a US Territory. Theodore Roosevelt also contracted the initiative to the establishment of the Panama Canal. This act put the United States in a good position for moving goods, supporting international trade and positioning the US forces in Central America. Theodore Roosevelt also was responsible for the Monroe Doctrine that allowed the United States to serve as the policeman of the Western Hemisphere. He was a mediator for peace between Russia and Japan during the Russo-Japanese War. For this, Roosevelt received the Nobel Peace Prize. In doing so, he strengthened the United States relationship with other countries. Finally, towards the end of his appointment, a navy fleet commonly known as the “Great White Fleet” sailed across the world showing the dominance of the United States and drawing up domestic support for the Navy. 
     When it came to Theodore Roosevelt’s education, he started as a homeschool student eventually attended Harvard. He would later become a member of the Rough Riders during the Spanish American war. He then became governor of New York and he then ran for Vice President with William McKinley. McKinley died, and then Theodore Roosevelt assumed the presidency. He liberated Panama and constructed that Panama Canal. Roosevelt received the Nobel Peace Prize for making peace with Japan and Russia. He ran for a third term as a third party candidate that he founded called the “Bull Moose” party.  This political party consisted of the Progressive Republicans and lost, but the legacy of Bull Moose lives on in the Democratic party that we know today. 
    Theodore Roosevelt was Great at compromising with foreign adversaries with his Communication abilities. He was able to make peace with two international superpowers, and he was able to liberate Panama. He was so good with foreign-policy that according to Siena College Research he was rated Number for in an expert pole in 2010. 
    Accomplishing tasks internationally is one thing, but performing them domestically is another. Theodore Roosevelt was able to bring about a significant change to the commonwealth. One of the main ideas that he initiated was his ability to break up the trusts also known as monopolies. His central ideology was that the government had the right to regulate big business to protect the welfare of society. He acted against the Northern Securities Company he used the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890 against the Company when the US Supreme Court ruled in favor of the government and ordered the company to dismantle he became to be known as the “Trust Buster.” Other businesses realized even though Roosevelt was a republican president they would not be able to operate without consideration for the people. Many other acts were to follow. He enacted Child Labor Laws, the Hepburn Act, Food, and Drug Act, and the Meat Inspection Act to name a few. These acts made food safer and prevented children from being overworked, regulated standard pricing for transport. He also provided regulation send regulation to the wrong road to Charge. He allowed the citizens to become involved in the process as well.
    Theodore Roosevelt was also willing to take risks for the betterment of the country. He stood up for what he believed in his integrity to try to do the right thing. On multiple occasions, he told presidents when they were doing wrongs such as Woodrow Wilson, and Taft. Theodore Roosevelt is to support Taft because he had a similar perspective of breaking up trusts. But Taft Took it too far when he wanted to Break up the steel trust. Theodore Roosevelt made it public that that was a good trust and what he was doing didn't go with the principles of his ideas. 
    Theodore Roosevelt was also very intelligent. When growing up, Young Theodore Roosevelt was a homeschool student. Having not gone to public schools he focused his studies in the sciences, geography, and history. He struggled in mathematics, and languages though. He not only was a student at Harvard but also studied at Columbia Law school. It was said that he had a near photographic memory in a report. When his father died in the second year of his Harvard year, he inherited I hundred and $125,000 enough to live the rest of his life. However, he chose to go to schooling and further at Columbia law.
    Perhaps one thing that Theodore Roosevelt had the most of was a leader. He led for the Roughriders, a voluntary Calvary in the Spanish American war. A quote from Theodore Roosevelt says, “If I have anything at all resembling genius, it is the gift of leadership.” Theodore Roosevelt took action, some of the most Executive orders given out by a president.
    After his presidency he continued to live a remarkable life, Theodore Roosevelt went on safari expeditions and hunted various species from around the world which he contributed to the Smithsonian Museum. He stayed out of the limelight until the outbreak of the first World War. He was a strong supporter of the war effort giving speeches and supporting the bond drives. Theodore Roosevelt died in his sleep January 6, 1919. It was said that death had to take him while he split else it would have fought with its hands.     
    Theodore Roosevelt was a man that had a lot to do with how the country is shaped today. He cared for citizens, before big business, he signed many executive orders that improved the lives of the people. Most importantly Theodore was right to himself; he didn’t need to pretend who he was to appease a vote. He was one of the most True-to-himself presidents that we have ever had. And this is what makes a good president.
